# Roadmap for the extension

## Who?

* Main developer: @notabene
* based on work by @ffoodd (a11y.css creator) and @ireade (porting to an extension)

## Why?

* CORS security prevent from running bookmarklets more and moer often
* Extensions = easier scripting capacities (e.g. on/off on a set of tests)

## What are we going to do?

Step by step at this date (end November 2017)

1. ~~Create an empty WebExtension~~
2. ~~Add a simple popup~~
3. ~~Test for browser language (accept-language?): is this language implemented in a11y.css?~~
    * ~~If yes, serve the same language~~
    * ~~Else, serve English~~
4. ~~Provide non-functioning buttons in the popup with utilities~~
    * ~~First batch: outline focus.~~
    * ~~First batch: a11y.css (find a proper label to identify button?).~~
    * ~~First batch: leave space for other tools~~
    * Second batch: Check alt images.
5. Outline focus (why, you ask? Well, because it's the simplest thing I have in store)
6. Implement a11y.css
    * Localised (do something like a locales.json) WE'RE HALFWAY THERE ALREADY
    * Up to date with `a11y.css/css`
